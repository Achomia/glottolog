# Glottolog Languoid Data

Glottolog data related to [languoids](http://glottolog.org/meta/glossary#Languoid) is curated in this directory.
The classification tree is mirrored in the hierarchical directory structure of the `tree` subdirectory, and 
languoid-specific information is kept in text files following the [INI file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format
within the respective directory of the languoid the information pertains to.

To allow easier access to the languoid information files, three index documents are automatically generated:

- [Languages](languages.md)
- [Families](families.md)
- [Dialects](dialects.md)
