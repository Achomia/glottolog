[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E17/E18/E19 has separate entries for Yitha Yitha [xth] and Dadi Dadi [dda] but they are close enough linguistically to be one and the same language which may be called Lower Darling-Lower Lachlan (**hh:hvw:Waferetal:New-South-Wales.e:Beveridge:Riverina**). See also: Lower Darling-Lower Lachlan [NOCODE_Lower-Darling-Lower-Lachlan].
