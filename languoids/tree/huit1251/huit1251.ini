[classification]
family = **140034** clearly demonstrates the internal unity of Boran and Huitotoan respectively, on the grounds of shared basic lexicon (including pronouns). The Boran to Huitotoan comparisons, however, show irregular correspondences **75011**, **112768** and are therefore premature.
sub = **112768**
