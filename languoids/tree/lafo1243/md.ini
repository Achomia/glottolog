[classification]
family = Tegem systematically stands out from Narrow Talodi lexically, pronominally, in
	the noun class system and alleged sound correspondences are often irregular. The
	alleged noun class form/meaning correspondences to other Kordofanian groups,
	namely Rashad and Heiban, in **hh:hv:Schadeberg:Kordofanian**,
	**hh:hv:Schadeberg:Kordofanische** are not convincing as conclusively genetic; As
	to form, there is much eclectic selection as well as irregular correspondences,
	and as to meaning, the methodology of finding non-cognate shared class items is
	highly dubious. Chance resemblance has not been excluded. The lexical evidence
	for a Kordofanian unity is weak in the extreme **hh:hv:Blench:Kordofanian**. It
	follows that the arguments presented for a Niger-Congo affiliation are not
	compelling either.
