[classification]
family = The inclusion of the poorly known Karas is best argued in **hh:hvw:Cowan:Ambtelijk**:33-36, with systematic correspondences in pronominals and a few items of basic vocabulary. Evidence for inclusion in Trans New Guinea is weak **hh:hvld:Voorhoeve:CWTNG**:432-437, both lexically and pronominally, cf.~**hh:hv:Pawley:Chequered-TNG**:94-95. Likewise, the East Timor/Alor comparisons in **hh:hv:Hull:Timor** are flimsy.
