[classification]
family = I have not been able to replicate the lexicostatistic argument for a relation between all Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, i.e.~with East Timor **478195**, and the correspondes adduced in **309489** are suggestive but so far too few to conclude a relationship. The lexical and pronominal evidence for a Trans New Guinea affiliation is much too weak **90372**:683, **100260**, cf.~**108875**:94-95. The newest comparison of cognates **91131**:6-11 cannot muster a strong case (correspondences are few, weak and not systematic enough).
