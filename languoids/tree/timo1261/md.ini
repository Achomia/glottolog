[classification]
family = The lexical and pronominal evidence for a Trans New Guinea affiliation is much too weak **90372**:683, **100260**, cf.~**108875**:94-95. The newest comparison of cognates **91131**:6-11 cannot muster a strong case (correspondences are few, weak and not systematic enough). Likewise, the Bomberai/Alor comparisons in **85492** are flimsy.
