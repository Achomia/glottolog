[classification]
family = The group is clearly internally coherent. I have not been able to replicate the lexicostatistic argument for a relation between all Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, i.e.~with West Timor-Alor-Pantar and Kolana-Tanglapui **478195**, and the correspondes adduced in **309489** are suggestive but so far too few to conclude a relationship. Likewise, the Bomberai/Alor comparisons in **85492** are flimsy.
