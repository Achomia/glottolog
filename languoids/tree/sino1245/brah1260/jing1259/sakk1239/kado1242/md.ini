comment = Research conducted in 2008 showed that Kadu and Kanan speakers do not adequately understand each other's languages, and have to switch to Burmese in order to communicate with speakers from the other community. Kadu and Kanan people also have strong separate identities and have a desire to have separate literature. In addition, Myanmar's official list of ethnic groups lists Kadu and Kanan as separate language groups.
