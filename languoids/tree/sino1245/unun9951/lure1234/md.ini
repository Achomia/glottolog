[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Luren is an ethnic group of Guizhou province of China which is typically
	classified as Manchu. The data in
	(**hh:wsoc:GPECC:Nanjing-Longjia**) shows that it is a new Tibeto-Burman
	language which is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. I wish to thank Andrew Hsiu for
	bringing this language to my attention.
