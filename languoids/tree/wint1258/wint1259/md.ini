comment = Modern scholars of Wintuan languages are in agreement that Wintu, Nomlaki and Patwin are three separate languages. The most thorough discussion of the language and dialect situation in all three of the Wintuan languages is in Whistler's (1980) dissertation (pp. 15– 30, 46–53). Shepherd's (2005) book on Proto-Wintuan also distinguishes these three languages (see esp. pp. 1–4). Other more general works in agreement are: Golla (2011, 140–147), Mithun (1999, 560–563), and Campbell (1997, 128). The discussion in Golla (2011) of the dialect continuum between Wintu and Nomlaki should by no means rule out their being recognized as two distinct languages. Dialect continuums are not uncommon in geographically adjacent languages which are closely related. Authors of ethnographies, grammars, dictionaries and collections of texts are careful to distinguish the three groups both ethnographically and linguistically: cf. for Patwin, Kroeber (1932) and Whistler (1977, 1978); for Nomlaki, Goldschmidt (1951); and for Wintu, Shepherd (1989), Pitkin (1984, 1985), and Schlichter (1981).
