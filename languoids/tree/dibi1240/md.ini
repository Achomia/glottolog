[classification]
family = Dibiyaso is often associated with its northern neighbour Bosavi through a small
	number of matching lexical items. **hh:hvw:Reesink:Aramia**:12 gives a number of
	lexical lookalikes between Dibiyaso and Kaluli. These contain a few fairly
	convincing comparisons where Dibiyasu p corresponds to Kaluli f. The items in
	question are common to the entire Bosavi Watershed group (not just Kaluli) but
	none are found in the Etoro-Bedamini group. This suggests, that we are dealing
	with loans between Dibiyaso and the Bosavi watershed group. Similarly, Turumsa
	and Dibiyaso are said to share as much as 19% lexicostatistical similarity
	**hh:el:Tupper:Turumsa**, but, looking at the items in question and the
	sociolinguistic situation, a loan scenario is preferable to a genealogical one.
