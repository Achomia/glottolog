[classification]
family = The family is assumed on lexical similarities hinted at by Laycock. What little data on Yuat that was available to Foley in connection with his demonstration of the Lower Sepik-Ramu family, it was not sufficient for a genetic relationship with Lower Sepik-Ramu. Sufficient argumentation for a relation with the Mongol-Langam languages is wanting **hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**.
