name = Central Sudanic
level = family

[classification]
family = No conclusive, methodologically sound basis for assigning Central Sudanic to an alleged full or partial Nilo-Saharan has been presented **hh:hv:Blench:Nilo-Saharan**, **hh:hv:Bender:Nilo-Saharan:2000**, **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:Nilo-Sahariennes**. Although not included in the Central Sudanic comparison by **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:CSudanic**, Birri is very likely a Central Sudanic language in the light of the comparisons by **hh:hv:Vorbichler:Mamvu-Balese** (I wish to thank Roger Blench, Don Killian and Tom Güldemann for insisting on the strong parallels between Birri and Central Sudanic). The Kresh-Aja group has not yet been shown to be bona fide Central Sudanic **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:CSudanic**.
