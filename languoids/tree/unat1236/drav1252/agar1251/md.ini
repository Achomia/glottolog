[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Agaria [agi] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a Munda language. First of all, the
	entry conflates information from different tribes with a similar sounding name
	(**hh:e:Crooke:Agaria**). Second there is no attested Agaria language
	(**hh:e:Elwin:Agaria**:xxvii) so any suspicions that they spoke a Gond
	(Dravidian!) language
	(**hh:e:Dimaggio:Agaria**, **hh:e:RussellHiralal:Agaria**) is undemonstrable.
	E16/E17/E18/E19 lists Agoria as a dialect name which seems to explain how the
	erroneous Munda affiliation came into place. It seems that E16/E17/E18/E19
	confused Agaria with ``Aghoria'', an alternative name for the neighbouring group
	Asur who, like the Agaria, are iron-smelters (**hh:hew:Dalton:Bengal**,
	**hh:e:Elwin:Agaria**:xxvii). Asuri [asr], which is an attested Munda language
	(**hh:ld:Konow:Asuri**), is already listed in E16/E17/E18/E19. This makes Agaria
	[agi] a spurious entry in any corrected reading of it since Asur is already
	listed in the E16/E17/E18/E19 and the assumed Dravidian-descendent Agaria
	language is not attested. See also: Asuri [asr].
