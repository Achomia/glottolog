[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry for Giyug [giy]. Giyug refers to an unattested
	speech variety of Giyug island and reports available regarding its status are
	all second-hand and do not necessarily indicate that the language was actually
	unintelligible to those of the mainland (**hh:s:Ford:Bachamal**). I wish to
	thank Ian Green and Mark Harvey for discussing this question with me.
