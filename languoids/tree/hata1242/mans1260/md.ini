[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Mansim/Borai, a language related to Hatam on the northeastern Bird's Head of
	Indonesian Papua, is presented as a different language (rather than dialect)
	from Hatam in **hh:s:Reesink:Mansim**:304-305 and comparisons of old wordlists
	(e.g.~**hh:hvw:vonderGabelentzMeyer:Melanesischen**) readily confirm this
	difference. Mansim has been assumed to be extinct
	(**hh:s:Reesink:Mansim**), but persistent rumours in the Manokwari area suggest
	that there are still as many as 50 senior speakers (own field work, 2010). The
	existence of remaining speakers would also be consistent with the last known
	published population survey of half a century ago (**hh:he:Pans:Arfakkers**).
	Mansim is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19.
