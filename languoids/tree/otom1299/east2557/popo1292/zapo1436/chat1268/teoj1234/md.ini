[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Chatino from Teojomulco was documented by a wordlist in
	**hh:w:Belmar:Chatina-Dialectos** before it went extinct. As shown by **hh:hvw:Sullivant:Teojomulco-Chatino** this turns out to be the most divergent of the Chatino languages and as such easily constitutes it own language, missing from E16/E17/E18/E19.
