[classification]
family = **hh:hv:Wurm:Trans-Fly**:325 claims that Waia is related to the Pahoturi languages
	but adduces no evidence and there is certainly nothing obvious that links the
	two. Pronouns were not explicitly examined (and perhaps not implicitly either)
	by Ross **hh:hv:Ross:Pronouns** but, in any case, they do not match Pahoturi.
