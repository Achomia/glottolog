family = Convincing published lexical evidence exist for the relatedness of Northern-Southern Je in a Je subgroup **85851**, Je-Jabuti **105441**, Je-Karaja **306521**:268-287, Je-Rikbaktsa **76034**, Ofaye **54471**, Maxakalian-Je **48053**, **111963**, Je-Aimore **80559**. For Kamakanan the lexical parallels adduced by **158410** remain to be corroborated using Kamakanan proto-forms **79381** **475740**. For Puri-Coroado the lexical parallels adduced by **153186** cannot be taken as proof of a genealogical relationship **475740**. For Kariri, Bororoan and Chiquitano there is suggestive, but not conclusive grammatical evidence **306521**:265 **63035** **73916** (also shared by Carib and Tupi **75120**) and little in the way of lexicon. For Fulniô, Guató and Otí there is insufficient evidence whatsoever **306521**:262-287.
