[classification]
family = The inclusion of the poorly known Karas is best argued in **126844**:33-36, with systematic correspondences in pronominals and a few items of basic vocabulary. Evidence for inclusion in Trans New Guinea is weak **300404**:432-437, both lexically and pronominally, cf.~**108875**:94-95. Likewise, the East Timor/Alor comparisons in **85492** are flimsy.
