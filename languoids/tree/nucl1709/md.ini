See also **120523**:97 and **21928**:146 **475286** for re-subgrouping of a few languages. The Bikaru-Bragge wordlist in **22758** presumably represents the Pikaru dialect of Bisorio (an Engan language) despite the divergence of the two, since the body part terms agree and the elicitation sessions were monolingual.
