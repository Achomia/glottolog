[classification]
family = The evidence for including Marrku-Wurrugu in Iwaidjan is not sufficient as the similarities may well be due to borrowing in the case of Marrku **127291** and the very poorly attested Wurrugu was included because of its lexical correspondences with Marrku rather than the rest of Iwaidjan **78115**.
