[classification]
family = Jiamao [jio] has recently been suggested as a language isolate with heavy Hlai overlay **141426**. However, if the suggestion of massive borrowing from Hlai into Jiamao is in fact correct, so little residual vocabulary remains that it appears insufficient for positing a new language isolate. Therefore Jiamao is counted as a Hlai, and thus Tai-Kadai, language.
