[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has two entries Leti (Cameroon) [leo] and Mengisa [mct]. Leti [leo] is the ancestral language of the Mengisa ethnic group who are switching to Eton [eto]. The Eton that most Mengisa now speak is not linguistically remarkable (**hh:g:Geslin-Houdet:Mengisa**). Thus the Mengisa entry is duplicated whether or not it refers to the ancestral or the contemporary language. (In addition, the Leti [leo] language is so close to Tuki [bag] as to perhaps count as a dialect of it (**hh:styp:Biloa:Tuki**:37-38).) See also: Tuki [bag], Mengisa [mct], Eton-Mengisa [eto].
