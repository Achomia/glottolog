[classification]
family = The core is held together by regular sound correspondences in lexical items between subfamily languages, less systematic verbal extensions and noun class systems **101318**, **79953**, **116842**, **158466**, **82736**, **12162**, **20691**, **36490**. Mande, Kordofanian, Ijoid and Dogon have not yet been shown to stand up to these criteria wherefore they are excluded. The Pre or Mbre language in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, known from wordlists only, is Atlantic-Congo but cannot be assigned to a specific branch at this time **107427**, **45054**. The Mpra (= Mpre) language in Ghana has cognates with Atlantic-Congo especially Guang **117441**, including numerals 2-5, but the bulk of the little vocabulary that is known, is not Atlantic-Congo **322081**. On the grounds that the numerals are less likely to be borrowed, and that lexical innovation may produce vocabulary that looks unrelated to anything else, we count Mpra as an Atlantic-Congo language.
