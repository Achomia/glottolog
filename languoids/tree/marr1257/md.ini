name = Marrku-Wurrugu
level = family

[classification]
family = The evidence for including Marrku in Iwaidjan is not sufficient as the similarities may well be due to borrowing **127291**. The very poorly attested Wurrugu has lexical correspondences with Marrku rather than the rest of Iwaidjan **78115**.
