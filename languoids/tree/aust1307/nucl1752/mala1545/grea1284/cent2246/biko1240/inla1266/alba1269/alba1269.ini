comment = The currently-existing "Bicolano, Albay" does not correspond to any of the accepted Bikol subgroupings, the most widely-recognized of which is McFarland (1974) which was also adopted by Zorc (1977). Jason Lobel, the supporter of this request, has also done extensive research on the languages of the Bikol region, and his findings largely support those of McFarland (1974) and likewise do not support a "Bicolano Albay" language that would include Buhi'non, Miraya, and Bikol Libon. Such a language is also not supported by the identities of the people of Albay province themselves. Therefore, it is requested that the "Bicolano Albay" entry be split into four entries, "Bikol West Albay", "Bikol Miraya", "Bikol, Libon", and "Bikol Buhi'non". (Note also that calling any of these languages "Bicolano" or "Bikolano" is a mistake because "Bikolano" is the name of the ethnic group while "Bikol" is the name of the languages.)
