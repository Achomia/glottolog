[classification]
family = **100446** carefully reviewed the evidence for Pano-Tacanan and concluded it is suggestive but insufficient. Later dicta **41201**:419 and re-examinations **97268**, **400005** provided stronger evidence for Pano-Tacanan (cf.~**319362**) but not (yet) conclusive. Yora is mutually intelligible with Yaminahua **17194**:32-42. The minuscule wordlist in **104642** of Chiriva **61299**:250 is probably Panoan.
