[classification]
family = The arguments for considering Kenaboi a taboo-jargon are not compelling **86940**, **150947**. Although potential cognates can be found for a fraction of the Kenaboi forms **150947**, they are widely scattered and without systematicity. The simplest explanation is then that Kenaboi is an isolated language and that the similarities to remote branches of Austronesian and Austroasiatic are chance resemblances.
