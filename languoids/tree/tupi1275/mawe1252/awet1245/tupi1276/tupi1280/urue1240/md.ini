[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Of the languages of Tupi-Guarani subgroup VII,
	there is considerable overdifferentiation.  Júma or Arara-Kawahib
	[jua], Amundava [adw], Tenharim [pah], Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau [urz] and Karipúna (if it
	refers to Kawahib-Karipuna) [kuq] all speak easily mutually intelligible
	varieties
	(**hh:hvw:Sampaio:Tupi-Kawahib**, **hh:e:Levi-Strauss:Tupi-Cawahib**,
	**hh:e:Kastner:Urueuwauwau**, **hh:e:Leonel:Urueu-au-au**,
	**hh:h:Loukotka:Tupi-Guarani**),
	as also acknowledged by the E16/E17/E18/E19 entries themselves whose regions,
	dialects and speaker numbers overlap.  Paranawát [paf] is a name for a people of
	the same complex met with (and attested by wordlists) by the Rondon commission
	(**hh:hw:Rondon:Silvicolas**). Morerebi [xmo] is an uncontacted group of the Rio
	Preto and Marmelos, who speak another variety of the this language, if they
	still exist (**hh:e:Kastner:Urueuwauwau**).
	Wiraféd [wir], also known as Tupi do Machado or Bocas Pretas, is amply attested
	in wordlists from the past century
	(**hh:w:Koch-Grunberg:Maue**, **hh:w:Loukotka:Inedits**,
	**hh:hw:Nimuendaju:Icana**, **hh:w:Hanke:Parintintin**,
	**hh:w:NimuendajudoValleVentes:Peu**)
	and is hardly distinguishable from Apiaká [api]
	(**hh:w:NimuendajudoValleVentes:Peu**:222-223,
	**hh:h:Loukotka:Tupi-Guarani**), which also is so close that it could also count
	as the Kawahib-language. See also: Amundava [adw], Júma [jua], Morerebi [xmo],
	Karipúna [kuq], Apiaká [api], Wiraféd [wir], Paranawát [paf], Tenharim [pah].
