[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Jicaque or Tol [jic] of Honduras had a relative in Nicaragua which is now extinct but was so different that the two could not have been intelligible (**hh:hw:Lehmann:Zentral-Amerika:II**). This Western Jicaque language is thus missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. See also: Tol [jic].
