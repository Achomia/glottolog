comment = Among its many entries in the Campa group, E16/E17/E18/E19
	lists Ashéninka, South Ucayali [cpy].  However, unlike the other Campan
	languages, it is not placed on the map, and in the region where the entry places
	it (Upper Ucayali River and tributaries), the survey by
	**hh:hvw:Heitzman:Campa** has varieties that fall under other Campan entries in
	E16/E17/E18/E19.
