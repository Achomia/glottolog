comment = Among its many entries in the Campa group, E16/E17/E18/E19
	lists Ashéninka, South Ucayali [cpy].  However, unlike the other Campan languages, it is not placed on the map, and in the region where the entry places it (Upper Ucayali River and tributaries), the survey by **hh:hvw:Heitzman:Campa** has varieties that fall under other Campan entries in E16/E17/E18/E19.
