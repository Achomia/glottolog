[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 lists Imeraguen [ime] as an unclassified language of Mauretania spoken by an ethnic group traditionally subsisting on fishing. Presumably based on a blanket statement by
	**hh:e:Gerteiny:Mauritania**:56, E16/E17 reports that it is
	``Reportedly a variety of Hassaniyya structured on an Azer (Soninke)
	base''.  However, it is unclear what
	**hh:e:Gerteiny:Mauritania**:56's statement is based on and no data or other evidence for the Azer-Ḥassāniyya mix is adduced. Other ethnographers with field experience, notably
	**hh:ld:Fortier:Imraguen**, say they speak Ḥassāniyya with some special vocabulary related to fishing.
	The specific forms of the fishing vocabulary are cited and they clearly derive from a Berber (not Azer) source, and there is no ethnohistoric evidence for an Azer origin either
	(**hh:ld:Fortier:Imraguen**). Since there is insufficient evidence to posit a past or present separate language for the Imraguen,
	the entry is spurious.
