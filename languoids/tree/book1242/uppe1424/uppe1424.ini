[iso_retirement]
comment = Since there is deemed no basic language communication differences between Upper and Lower Tanudan, in regards to the Kalinga language, the proposal is to reflect that lack of difference in merging the two into simply Tanudan. This proposal is associated with the Change Request for the retirement of the Upper Tanudan language code.
