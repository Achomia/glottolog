comment = Since there is deemed no basic language communication differences between Upper
	and Lower Tanudan, in regards to the Kalinga language, the proposal is to
	reflect that lack of difference in merging the two into simply Tanudan. This
	proposal is associated with the Change Request for the retirement of the Upper
	Tanudan language code.
