[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Ndaktup [ncp] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate language but the survey of **hh:hvw:Mclean:Mfumte** shows is to be intelligible to and part of the same language as that in the Kwaja [kdz] entry. The two together may be labeled the Eastern Mfumte language. See also: Kwaja-Ndaktup [kdz].
