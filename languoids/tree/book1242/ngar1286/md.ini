comment = Dr. Bowern judges the two languages Yinhawangka and Ngarla to be different. They are associated with different locations, as provided on the New Code Request form.
	We believe that Dr. Bowern's research and expertise on languages of Australia, as well as the support of the sources listed below are sufficient to define this as a distinct language.
