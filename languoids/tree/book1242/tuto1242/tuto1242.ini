[iso_retirement]
comment = Bisaya in Brunei and Sarawak is the same cross-border language.
	We are also proposing to retire the designations Tutong 1 and Tutong 2, as researchers have used these terms with conflicting designations. The language in the Dusunic group (formerly Tutong 1) should be called Brunei Bisaya, which includes as dialects Sarawak Bisaya and Tutong 1/Southern Bisaya.
