[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E17/E18/E19 has an entry Arakwal [rkw] for an extinct Australian language.
	Although Arakwal may be an (old or recent) ethnic group,
	linguistically it is one of many Bandjalang [bdy] varieties
	(**hh:h:Oates:Australia:1975**:212,
	**hh:hvw:Waferetal:New-South-Wales**:354) and should not have a separate entry
	in a linguistic catalogue. See also: Bandjalang [bdy].
