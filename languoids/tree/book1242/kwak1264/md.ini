[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kwak [kwq] appeared as Nkwak in the 1992 Index of Nigerian Languages
	(**hh:h:CrozierBlench:Nigerian:1992**), but was withdrawn from the 3rd
	(**hh:h:Blench:Atlas**) since it had been discovered as a place in the Hyam area
	(I wish to thank Roger Blench for clarifying this matter to me). Despite reports
	to the E16/E17
	editor, it has not been taken out.
