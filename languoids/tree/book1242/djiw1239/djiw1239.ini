comment = Dr. Bowern (p.c.), Peter Austin (http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVLPages/AborigPages/LANG/WA/4_4_15.htm, Austin, Peter. 1983. Classification of Southern Pilbara Languages.), and Alan Dench (Dench, Alan. 1995. Pacific Linguistics, 71. University of California) all support Thiin's existence as separate from Djiwarli.
	Together Djiwarli and Thiin form a subgroup "Kanyara-Mantharta" languages under Pama- Nyungan, South-West, Coastal Ngayarda.
	We believe that Dr. Bowern's research and expertise on languages of Australia, as well as the support of the sources listed below are sufficient to define this as a distinct language.
