comment = There is 82% lexical similarity between Tomyang and Yamphu. The original Ethnologue entry for Tomyang was created before this data became available. A news article in a local newspaper stated that a new language, Tomyang, had been discovered by Nepali linguists. Further information revealed that the only Tomyang data collected was a Swadish 100 words list. And out of those, 21% are Nepali loan words. Also the wordlist was collected outside the area in which it is spoken and was, therefore, not compared to Yamphu, which is the main language in that area. It is proposed to list Tomyang as a dialect of Yamphu until more information could confirm it is a separate language.
