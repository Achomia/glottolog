comment = Erromintxela, "Basque Romany", is not mutually intelligible with Iberian Calo패
	because 1) the grammar of Erromintxela is entirely based on Basque rather than
	on Spanish or Portuguese and 2) the Romany component is based on Kalderash
	Romany rather than Calo패. There is no context in which these languages may be
	considered parts of a whole.
