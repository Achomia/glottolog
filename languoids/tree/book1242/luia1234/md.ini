[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 lists Lui [lba] as an unclassified Tibeto-Burman language of Myanmar (E16/E17/E18/E19, 200 speakers) or of India
	(E16/E17/E18/E19, extinct) without giving a location. Lui is a derogatory term meaning 'serf' and has been applied to several different languages
	(**hh:hew:McCulloch:Munnipore**,
	**hh:hew:Luce:Burma**:36-46).  Without a more precise denotation, such an entry is spurious.
