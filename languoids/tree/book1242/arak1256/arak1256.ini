comment = Based on word lists recently elicited, lexical similarity percentages between Marma and Rakhine are 62-68%. Intelligibility testing was also done by playing a Rakhine story among Marma mother tongue speakers in two Marma villages. The average scores in the two villages were 73% and 53%, indicating insufficient inherent intelligibility. Also, during the course of survey fieldwork, the term "Arakanese" was not mentioned by either the Marma or the Rakhine. Rather, the Marma refer to themselves as Marma, and the Rakhine refer to themselves as Rakhine.
