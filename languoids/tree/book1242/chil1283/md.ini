[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18 has an entry for Chilean Quechua [cqu] but this variety is an extension of the variety in the South Bolivian Quechua
	[quh] entry, and the nation border does not correspond to any linguistic division (p.c.~Paul Heggarty 2011). See also: South Bolivian Quechua [quh].
