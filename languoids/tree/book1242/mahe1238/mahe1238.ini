comment = We can find no evidence of the existence of this language in Yunnan Province, China, from Chinese and foreign linguistic sources. The Ethnologue editor has tracked the origins of this Ethnologue entry back to a 1953 thesis by linguist Dave Thomas. This work is apparently merely repeating a ethnonym cited by a non-linguist foreigner in 1949. The original work does not claim this to be a unique language. Therefore in the absence of any additional data, it appears best to remove this ISO code and consider this name to not refer to any unique language.
