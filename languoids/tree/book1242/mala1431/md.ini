comment = We have not been able to find evidence that this language exists. As far as we can see, it is not mentioned in the professional linguistic literature. The website of Global Recordings Network contains an audio-recorded story said to be in the Malakhel language; however, I listened to it and identified the language in the audio recording to be Ormuri [oru].
