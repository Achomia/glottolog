[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry Tapeba [tbb] representing people of Cear√° state in
	Brazil with indigenous background and a common identity. However, the common
	identity is recently formed and does not correspond to a past or present
	language, as the ancestors of the present Tapeba spoke languages such as Kariri,
	Tremembe and likely others (**hh:h:Barretto:Tapebas**, **hh:h:Studart:Ceara**)
	which either have entries of their own or are too poorly known to show if they
	were separate languages. Since E16/E17/E18/E19 is a catalogue of languages,
	a Tapeba [tbb] entry is spurious.
