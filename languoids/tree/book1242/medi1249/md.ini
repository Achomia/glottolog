[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has three entries for ``Dorobo'' (hunter-gatherers in the vicinity of Maasailand) languages close to Okiek [oki] namely Mediak
	[mwx], Kisankasa [kqh] and Mosiro [mwy]. But our only source on Mediak
	[mwx] and Kisankasa [kqh] says ``The three names [Mediak, Mosiro and Kisankasa -- HH] given above would seem to denote one and the same type of Dorobo. I have been unable to discover any difference between them.'' (**hh:w:Maguire:Il-Torobo:1928**:134), so two of the three entries are spurious.
	 See also: Okiek [oki], Akie [mwy], Kisankasa [kqh].
