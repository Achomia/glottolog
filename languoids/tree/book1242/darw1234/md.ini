comment = Lexical similiarity of Dari and Darwazi is between 86% and 90%. Comprehension testing of Eastern Farsi (Dari) showed that Dari is highly intelligible for the Darwazi people. The Darwazi call their area Darwaz but not their speech variety. No one ever mentioned a language called Darwazi as his mother tongue. The Darwazi themselves explain that they speak Dari, acknowledging that their dialect is slightly different.
