comment = Panang” (Tibetan sbra.nag ‘black tent’) is the name of a particular subgroup of Amdo Tibetans.
	Denwood (1999:30) identifies their language as belonging to the category of “Amdo dialects with oral [onset consonant] clusters only”. My own examination of the data in Kara (1984) leads me to the same conclusion: this is nothing more than a variety of Amdo Tibetan. Varieties of Amdo Tibetan have a high degree of mutual intelligibility; Sung and
	lHa.byams rGyal (2005: xviii) give a typical report: “[T]he sub-dialects within the Amdo region display remarkable uniformity. Any two people from different places inside the Amdo region can usually communicate with little or no difficulty.”
	There is therefore no reason for “Panang” to have its own ISO-693-3 code.
