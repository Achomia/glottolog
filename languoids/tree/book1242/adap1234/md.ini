[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 lists Adap [adp] as a separate language but the area in which it is spoken falls under Dzongkha [dzo] in
	**hh:g:vanDriem:Dzongkha** and the lexicostatistical similarity is consistent with Adap being simply a dialect of Dzongkha [dzo]. See also: Dzongkha [dzo].
