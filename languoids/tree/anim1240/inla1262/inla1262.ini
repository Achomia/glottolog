[classification]
family = Internally, the membership of the geographically non-adjacent Ipikoi in the family was realised only in the early 1970s (**303435**):267-273. Evidence for a Trans New Guinea membership are the singular pronouns in the Minanibai branch and a few lexical items (**9720**):509-510 and **21928(**):152, 157 takes the pronoun evidence to be probative. However, the pronouns which look most like Trans New Guinea have not yet been shown to go back to proto-Inland Gulf, and even if we assume they are characteristic, the total of the evidence for a Trans New Guinea affiliation is very slight. Therefore, it would be premature to call Inland Gulf a branch of the Trans New Guinea family. No stronger cases for Inland Gulf affiliations to other (sub-)families have been put forward.
