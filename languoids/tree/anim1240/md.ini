[classification]
family = Not including Inanwatan, though typological affinities have been noted **44274**. Abom [aob] is included in the basis of lexicostatical similarities in the range 11-14\% **305861** and the gender forms of the verb pace the known caveats of lexicostatistics and transfer in endangered languages. The pronouns resemble the typical Trans New Guinea pattern and there are some parallels in the gender system to Ok, but this is not enough to conclude a Trans New Guinea affiliation for the Anim languages.
