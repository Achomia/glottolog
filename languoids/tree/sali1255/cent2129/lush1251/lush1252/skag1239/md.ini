[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has three entries Skagit [ska],
	Snohomish [sno] and Lushootseed [lut]. The Lushootseed name (and entry) is an
	umbrellic one, encompassing both Skagit [ska] and Snohomish [sno] which are
	mutually intelligible
	(**hh:hv:ThompsonKinkade:Northwest**:38).  Thus, Skagit [ska] and Snohomish
	[sno] and spurious entries given a Lushootseed
	[lut]-entry. If one were to separate Skagit [ska] and Snohomish
	[sno] despite the intelligibility, it would render the Lushootseed
	[lut]-entry spurious. See also: Snohomish [sno], Northern Lushootseed [lut].
