[classification]
family = The three languages are closely related (hinted at by Laycock, and confirmable
	in the unpublished wordlists). What little data on Mongol-Langam-Yaul that was
	available to Foley in connection with his demonstration of the Lower Sepik-Ramu
	family, it was not sufficient for a genetic relationship with Lower Sepik-Ramu.
	Sufficient argumentation for a relation with the Yuat languages is wanting
