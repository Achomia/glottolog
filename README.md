# The Glottolog Data Repository

The Glottolog data repository is the place where the data served by the
[Glottolog web application](http://glottolog.org) is curated. But the repository
also provides an alternative way to access Glottolog's data locally, and possibly
even locally customized in a fork of clld/glottolog.
